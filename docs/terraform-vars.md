# TFVars File

Terraform allows you to define variable files called `*.tfvars` to create a reusable file for all of your variables for a project. The following is an example that covers all of the required variables to run the majority of the Terraform examples in this repository. When a particular module does not use a variable, you see the following error, though you can ignore it.

You may still define environmental variables. These exported values will override any of the variables set in both the `variables.tf` file as well as the `terraform.tfvars` file.

```
│ Warning: Value for undeclared variable
│ 
│ The root module does not declare a variable named "operator_role_prefix" but a value was found in file
│ "terraform.tfvars". If you meant to use this value, add a "variable" block to the configuration.
│ 
│ To silence these warnings, use TF_VAR_... environment variables to provide certain "global" settings to all configurations in your organization. To
│ reduce the verbosity of these warnings, use the -compact-warnings option.
╵

```

The following example should serve as a basis for your own `*.tfvars` files. You can create multiple versions of this file, and then, apply and destroy using this file with the `-var-file=` flag.

> **NOTE**: The `token` value in this example requires you to generate an offline OCM token. You can do that in the [Red Hat Hybrid Cloud console](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token***REMOVED***.

### Example Terraform.tfvars

This example only includes the variables needed for creating your account-wide roles and creating cluster with a managed OIC configuration. You can also add the needed variables for creating your identity provider and machine pools to this file.

```
account_role_prefix = "<user-prefix>"
availability_zones   = ["<az-within-cloud-region>"]
cloud_region = "<aws-cloud-region>"
cluster_name = "<name-of-cluster>"
operator_role_prefix = "<user-prefix>
token = "<ocm-offline-token>"
url = "<url-of-environment"
```
