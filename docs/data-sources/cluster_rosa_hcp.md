## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Unique identifier of the cluster.

### Optional

- `domain_prefix` (String) The domain prefix is optionally assigned by the user.It will appear in the Cluster's domain when the cluster is provisionedIf not supplied, it will be auto generated.After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `kms_key_arn` (String) Used to encrypt root volume of compute node pools. The key ARN is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a AWS Key Management Service (KMS) Key. It is a unique, fully qualified identifier for the AWS KMS Key. A key ARN includes the AWS account, Region, and the key ID(optional). After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
