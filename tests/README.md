# RHCS Provider Function Verification Testing
This package is the automation package for Function Verification Testing on the terraform rhcs provider. 

## Structure of tests

## Contibute to terraform rhcs provider tests
Please read the structure and contribte code to the correct place

## Running
The cluster created by the automation scripts are shared across all of the test cases. [Why we need do this?](./docs/challenge.md***REMOVED***.

### Prerequisite
Please read repo's [README.md](../README.md***REMOVED***
#### Users and Tokens
To execute the test cases, we need to prepare the [offline token](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token/show***REMOVED***. Get the offline token and export as an ENV variable **rhcs_TF_TOKEN**.
* export rhcs_TF_TOKEN=<offline token>


#### Global variables
The default rhcs enviroment is `production`. To specify running on staging or local, can export the global vairable 
* export GATE_WAY="https://api.stage.openshift.com"


### To run with ginkgo directly
This only allow running the test cases one by one. option.
* Running all the CMS test cases
  * `ginkgo -v ./tests/e2e`
* Running a single test case with scenario
  * `ginkgo -v -focus <case title> ./tests/e2e`
* Running a set of test case with label filter
  * `ginkgo run --label-filter <filter> ./tests/e2e`
